## Culled from a Udemy class entitled ".NET Design Patterns" by Dmitri Nesteruk.

- SOLID Design Principles
	- Creational
	- Structural
	- Behavioral

- Additional:
	- Heavy use of ReSharper.
	- Liberal use of public fields (Not a recommendation.)
	- Ad-hoc use of dependency injection (Autofac.)
	- Some 3rd part NuGet packages.
	- Other:
		1. Sequence Processing (LINQ/Rx)
		2. Concurrency (TPL)
		3. DI.

- SOLID:
	- Introduced by Robert C. Martin in a long-winded yet not-too-deep novel.
	1. Single Responsibility Principle:
		- Any paticular class should have a single reason to change.
		- e.g.: A journal that collected entries, displayed entries, and also loaded from/saved to file system.
		- e.g.: Resolve was to create a seperate Persistence class.
	
	2. Open/Closed Principle:
		- e.g.: Ordering system: Products. Categories. Traits. With filtering.
		```csharp
			public static IEnumerable<Product> FilterBySize(IEnumerable<Product> products, Size size)
			{
				foreach(var p in products) if (p.Size == size) yield return p;
			}
		```
		- So, copy/paste in order to filter by color. And by both size and color. So, again, we open up the ProductFilter class.
		- Clases should be open for extension, but they should be closed for modification.
		- So the answer is inheritance. So we'll implement a specification pattern.
		- Extending a filter. We will never have to return to ProductFilter.
	
	3. Liskov Substitution Principle:
		- You should be able to substitue a base type for a subtype.
		- e.g.: Classic defination: Rectangles and squares. Static area calculation is width * height.
		- We now inherit a square from a rectangle yet enforce the idea that a square *must* be a square with the property 'setters.'
		- And then we fail. Rectange sq = new Square(); sq.Height = 4.
		- So we need to indicate the overrides with virtual properties on the base class.
		- e.g.: public override int Height;
	
	4. Interface Segregation Principle:
		- Stop implementing interfaces that are too large.
		- e.g.: You have an interface for a multi-functional printer: Print. Scan. Fax.

	5. Dependency Inversion Principle:
		- Allow high-level module to access some of the internals of the low-level module. System.ValueTuple.
		- e.g.: public properties and filtering. We end up accessing a low-lovel portion of the low-level module.
		- In practice, the low-level cannot change its mind. e.g.: Tuple versus Dictionary.
		- Instead, define an interface as the access control for data access.
		```csharp
			public interface IRelationship
			{
				IEnumerable<Person> FindAllChildrenOf(string name);
			}
		```
	
	- Summary:
		- Single Responsibility Principle:
			1. A class should have only one reason to change.
			2. Seperation of concerns - different classes handling ddifferent, independ tasks/problems.
		- Open-Closed Principle:
			1. Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. e.g.: Specification pattern.
		- Liskov Substition Pattern:
			1. You should be able to subscribe a base type for a subtype.
		- Interface Segretion Principle:
			1. Don't put too much into an interface; split it up into seperate interfaces.
			2. YAGNI: You ain't going to need it.
		- Dependency Inversion Principle:
			1. High-level modules should not depend upon low-level modules. Use abstractions.


## Creational

- Builder:
	- When construction gets a little too complicated.
	- Some objects are simple and can be created in a single constructor call.
	- Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create.
	- Having an object with ten constructor arguments is not productive. Instead, opt for piecewise construction.
	- Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step.
	- * Builder: When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly. *
- Life without Builder:
	- e.g.: Output a chunk of HTML. 
	```csharp
		StringBuilder.Append("<p>");
		StringBuilder.Append("Paragraph");
		StringBuilder.Append("</p>");
	```
- The Pattern:
	- e.g.: So we define a class called HtmlElement. And then we create an HtmlBuilder as an API.
	- Fluent builder: Chaining methods together.
	- Fluent builder(s) with inheritance. You are not allowed the containing type as the return type.
	- e.g.: A derived class needs to propogate its derived type via its base type. This is difficult and requires generic classes.
	- Faceted Builder: Building an address and employment information in a fluent manner. We want several builder facades.
	- e.g.: A person builder will maintain a reference to the sub-builders. The person builder conyains a *reference* to the person being built.
- Summary:
	- A builder is a seperate component for building an object.
	- It can either give builder a constructor or return it via a static function.
	- To make a builder fluent, return this.
	- Differet facets of an object can be built with different builders working in tandem via a base class.

- Factory:
	- Factory Method and Abstract Factory.
	- Object creation logic becomes too convoluted.
	- Constructor is not descriptive:
		1. The name is mandated by name of containing type.
		2. Cannot overload with same sets or arguments with different names.
		3. Can turn into 'optional parameter hell.'
	- Object creation (non-piecewise, unlike builder) can be outsourced to:
		1. A seperate function (Factory Method.)
		2. That may exist in a seperate class (Factory.)
		3. Can create hiearchy of factories with Abstract Factory.
	- Factory: A component responsible soley for the wholesale (not piecewise) creation of objects.
	- e.g.: Point example. Introducing different types to pass to a constructor. And a switch statement.
	- Abstract factory provides abstract objects. e.g. With method, abstract factory returned concrete point(s).
	- We will return abstract classes or interfaces. We will return two different objects with their own factories.
	- Tea and coffee. We will not return type T but an IHotDrink interface. But the associated enum breaks the open/closed principle.
	- So we scape the pbjects in a different manner and then use an int to obtain the provided factory. With OutOfIndex we return a NoOp IBeverage.
	- Summary:
		- A factory method is a static method that creates abjects.
		- A factory can take care of object creation.
		- A factory can be external or reside insode the object as an inner class.
		- Heirarchies of factories can be used to create related objects.

- Prototype:
	- When it's easier to copy an existing object to fully initialize a new one.
	- Motivation: Complicated objects are not designed from scratch.
		1. Reiterate existing designs.
	- An existing, partially or fully constructed, design is a prototype.
	- We make a copy, clone, of the prototype and customize it.
		1. Required 'deep copy' support.
	- Make the cloning convenient.
	- A partially or fully initiazed object that you copy (clone) and make use of.
	- Be careful that you are not 'cloning' by simply copying the reference. e.g.: Both Names[0] are now "Y."
	```csharp
		var x = new Person(new[] { "X", "XYZ" }, new Address("Duluth Avenue", 40));
        var y = x;
        y.Names[0] = "Y";
	```
	- *NOTE:* ICloneable is bad. The ieda is that the .NET framework offers up this interface.
	- The problem? Is it deep cloning or simply shallow cloning? Be careful about reference cloning. ICloneable returns an object... so, before generics. So cast to type.
	- ICloneable is a shallow copy. We copied a memory pointer with Address until we add ICloneable to the nested Address as well. Also, the Names[] offers only shallow copy.

	- One approach: Use a copy constructor. A C++ term.
	- Another: Create a DeepCopy() method via an interface<T>.
	- A serializer will obtain the entire tree. This is a better example of real-word deep copy. We stay away from interfaces in order *not* to mrak all of our (nested) classes.
	- Instead, build an extension method. And we'll need [Serializable()] decorators for binary serialization.
	- But not for XmlSerialization. However, we will need parameterless constructors for XML serialization.
	- Summary:
		- To implement a prototype, partially construct an onject and store it somewhere.
		- Clone the prototype:
			1. Implement your own functionality; or
			2. Serialize and deserialize. Guarenteed to traverse the entire object graph.

- Singleton:
	- The design pattern everyone loves to hate... but is it really that bad?
	- Motivation: It does make sense to have only one instance in the system. e.g.: a database loaded completely into memory. Also, object factory. A factory should not have any state.
	- e.g.: a lazy-loaded, thread-safe component. The argument is that we do not need multiple instances of the resourse. We want to provent anyone from making more than one instance.
	- 1. Make the constructor private. Serve up an instance. Make the thing lazy-loading using Lazy<T>. Note: Use a Lambda to new up the resource.
	```csharp
		private static Lazy<T> instance = new Lazy<T>(() => new T());
		public static T Instance => instance.Value;
	```
	- Beware unit testing of a wrapper class with a hard-coded reference to the static database.
	```csharp
    	foreach (var name in names)
        {
            totalPopulation += SingletonDatabase.Instance.GetPolulation(name);
        }
	```
	- So singleton with mocking and unit testing.
	- A static class with static members is terrible because it has not constructors. There is no dependency injection.
	- The Monostate pattern. e.g.: There can only be one CEO at the company at a given time. So static state exposed in a non-static manner.
	- We end up referencing the same data regardless of how many "different" objects that we create.
	- Summary:
		1. Making a 'safe' singleton is easy: construct a static Lazy<T> and return its value.
		2. Singletons are difficult to test.
		3. Instead of directly using a singleton, consider depending on an abstraction.
		4. Consider defining singleton lifetime in a DI container.


## Structural

- Adapter:
	- Getting the interface you want from the interface you have. e.g.: An adapter with the associated different power requirements.
	- A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y.
	- e.g.: A simple drawing application. Drawing pixels. With a DrawPoint(Point) method. And now vertor is introduced. Vectors are a collection of lines.
	- We need to adapt a given line into a set of points. An adapter can generate a lot of unnecessary information.
	- Adapter caching. Preserve information stored for future use. Use GetHashCode(). Avoid regeneration.
	- Summary:
		1. Implementing an adapter is easy.
		2. Determine the API you have and the API you need.
		3. Create a component which aggregates (has a reference to, ...) the adaptee.
		4. Intermediate representations can pile up; use caching and other optimizations.

- Bridge:
	- Connecting components together through abstractions.
	- Motivation: The bridge prevents a 'Cartesian product' complexity explosion.
	- Example:
		1. Base class ThreadSAcheduler.
		2. Can be preemptive or cooperative.
		3. Can run on Windows or Unix.
		4. You'll end up with a 2x2 scenario: WindowsPTS, UnixPTS, WindowsCTS, UnixCTS.
	- Bridge pattern avoid this entity explosion.
	- Bridge is: A mechanism that decouples an interface (hierarchy) from an implementation (hiererchy.)
	- Summary:
		1. Decouple abstraction from implementation.
		2. Both can exist as hierarchies.
		3. A stronger form of encapsulation. Less state explosion.

- Composite:
	- Treating individual and aggregate objects uniformily.
	- Objects use other objects' fields, properties, and members through inheritance and composition.
	- Composition lets us make compound objects.
		- e.g.: mathematical expression composed of simple expressions; or
		- A grouping of shapes that consist of several shapes.
		- Composite design pattern is used to treat both single (scalar) abd somposite objects uniformly.
			- e.g.: Foo and ICollection<Foo> have common APIs.
	- A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner.
	- Machine learning and Neuron Networks. 
	- Nerons can connect to other Neurn and can connect to Neuron "layers" (collection of Neurons.)
	- We need an extension method. So we treat *everything* like a collection. So every scalar values are treaded as composite values.
	- Summary:
		- Objects can use other object via inheritance/composition.
		- Some composed and singular objects need similar =/identical behavors.
		- Composite design pattern lets us treat both types of objects uniformly.
		- C# has special support for the enumeration concept.
		- A single object can masquerade as a collection with *yield return this*.

- Decorator:
	- Adding behavior without altering the class itself.
	- Motivation:
		1. Want to augment an object with additional fucntionality.
		2. Do not want to rewrite or alter existing code. (OCP.)
		3. Want to keep new functionality seperate. (SRP.)
		4. Need to be able to interact with existing structures.
		5. Two options:
			- Inherit from the required object if possible. (Not sealed.)
			- Build a decorator which simly references the decorated objects.
	- Decorator facilitates the addition of behaviors to individual objects without inheriting from them.
	- So, a decorator around a sealed class. e.g.: Stringbuilder(); Beware the fluent interface.
	- The vaunted decorator/adapter pattern. Real life: "Hello World." Inefficient string management. 
	- Stringbuilder with implecient string concatanation. e.g.: support s += "";
	```csharp
	public class MyStringBuilder
	{
		private StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder {};
		public static implicit operator MyStringBuilder(string str)
		{
			var msb = new MyStringBuilder {};
			msb.Append(str);
			return msb;
		}
		public static MyStringBuilder operator +(MyStringBuilder msb, string str)
		{
			msb.Append(str);
			return msb;
		}
		public override string ToString()
		{
			return sb.ToString();
		}
	}
	MyStringBuilder s = "Hello ";
	s += "World";
	```
	- Multiple inheritance.
